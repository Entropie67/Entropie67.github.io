 	    <h2><strong>Instagram</strong></h2>
      <p>Instagram, by Kevin Systrom and Michel Mike Krieger, 2010. Instagram is maybe the most used social network by young people. To give you an idea, more than 71% of the active users are less than 35 years old. As Facebook was created, Instagram appeared when Kevin Systrom was studying at Stanford University, while he was directing a photo club. Then, more and more tools like “hyperlapse” to realise time-lapses or “layout” to do photo collage has been added. Nowadays, it allows you to share photos and videos with your personal network or the entire world and to comment or “like” posts that you like. The reason which explain Instagram’s popularity is its simplicity.</p>

      <h2><strong>Snapchat</strong></h2>
      <p>Snapchat, by Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, 2011. It appeared one year after Instagram at the same place, Stanford University. It allows to send messages, photos or videos with a selectable self-destruction countdown timer. It is also the origin of the “stories”, which are photos or videos that can be seen by all your friends but that disappears 24 hours after their publication. More than 150 million people are registered on Snapchat and the ¾ of the users are less than 25 years old.</p>
